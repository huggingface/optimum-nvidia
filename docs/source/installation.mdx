# Installation

There is currently no `pip` support for `optimum-nvidia` as transitive dependencies are missing on PyPI.
To get started with Optimum-NVIDIA, you can:
- Pull the pre-built docker container `huggingface/optimum-nvidia`
- Build the docker container locally


## Pulling prebuilt Docker Container

Hugging Face pushes and hosts versions of the container matching the release version of `optimum-nvidia` on the Docker hub.
This container comes with all the required dependencies to execute `float32`, `float16`, `int8` compressed or quantized and `float8` models.

To get started, simply pull the container with the following command:
```bash
docker run -it --gpus all --ipc host huggingface/optimum-nvidia
```

## Building Docker Container locally

If you want to build your own image and/or customize it, you can do so by using the three steps process described below:

1. Clone `optimum-nvidia` repository:
```bash
git clone --recursive --depth=1 https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-nvidia && cd optimum-nvidia
2. Build the `tensorrt_llm:latest` image from the NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM repository. If you cloned the `optimum-nvidia` from
the step above, you can use the following command (assuming you're at the root of `optimum-nvidia` repository:

```bash
cd third-party/tensorrt-llm && make -C docker release_build CUDA_ARCHS="<TARGET_SMs>"
```

Where `CUDA_ARCHS` is a comma-separated list of CUDA architectures you'd like to support.
For instance here are a few examples of TARGET_SM values:
- `90-real` : H100/H200
- `89-real` : L4/L40/L40s/RTX Ada/RTX 4090
- `86-real` : A10/A40/RTX Ax000
- `80-real` : A100/A30
- `75-real` : T4/RTX Quadro
- `70-real` : V100

3. Finally, let's build the `huggingface/optimum-nvidia` docker image on-top of the `tensorrt_llm` layer:

```bash
cd ../.. && docker build -t huggingface/optimum-nvidia -f docker/Dockerfile .
```
