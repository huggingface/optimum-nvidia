# ðŸ¤— Optimum Nvidia

ðŸ¤— Optimum Nvidia provides seamless integrating for [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM) in the Hugging Face ecosystem.

While TensorRT-LLM provides the foundational blocks to ensure the greatest performances on NVIDIA GPUs, `optimum-nvidia` allows
to leverage the ðŸ¤— to retrieve and load the weights directly inside TensorRT-LLM while maintaining a similar or identical API compared to `transformers` and others ðŸ¤— libraries.

For NVIDIA Tensor Cores GPUs with `float8` hardware acceleration, `optimum-nvidia` allows to run all the necessary preprocessing steps required to target this datatype along with 
deploying the necessary technical blocks to ensure developer experience is fast and smooth for these architectures.
